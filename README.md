## I. Release Notes

### Release 1
- Functionality to create and send TIMs to RSUs by building a Path between mileposts
- Functionality to disable TIMs from RSUs

<a name="documentation"/>

## II. Documentation
The TIM Builder has been designed to be configurable enough to work with any group involved with the CV project. It has been integrated with Docker so that it can be deployed on a system without requiring a large list of dependencies. 

There are three Docker containers used when deploying this application:

* A MySQL database which contains data for RSUs, milepost locations, and ITIS codes 
* A Java Spring REST Service which retreives data from the MySQL database
* An Angular2 web front end for designing TIMs, sending them, and deleting existing TIMs off RSUs

Users will need to provides their own data in CSV files which will need to follow the format specified. More information on data entry can be found here (link to service README).  

This repository will be continually updated with adjustments to TIM fields.

## III. Getting Started

The following instructions describe the procedure to fetch, build, and run the application. 

### Prerequisites
* JDK 1.8: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
* Git: https://git-scm.com/
* Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

### Obtain the Source Code

#### Step 1 - Clone public repository

Clone the source code from the GitHub repository using Git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trihydro/jpo-tim-builder.git
(after pull request change to  -> git clone https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-tim-builder.git)
```

## IV. Running the Application
---
### Build and Deploy the Application

The REST service relies on Maven to manage builds and run unit tests.

**Step 1**: Build the REST service

Navigate to the service directory and build:

```bash
 cd service/complete
 mvn clean install
```
This build will run unit tests using an in-memory H2 database created with the SQL script unitTestSql.sql located at service\complete\src\main\resources\db. 

**Step 2**: Build Docker services 

Navigate back to the root directory and build the Docker services. This may take a some time to complete initially because Docker needs to download Node, and Java. 

```bash
 cd ../../
 docker-compose build
```

**Step 3**: Run the application

This command will download MySql, and start the MySQL, REST service, and web application containers. The application will then be accessable at  `localhost:4200`. 

```bash
 docker-compose up
```
